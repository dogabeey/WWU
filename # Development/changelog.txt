#--------------------------------------
- Overhauled Government Forms. The variety of government forms has been increased, with new unique forms such as Dragonflight Brood, Scarlet Crusade, etc being added for the relevant countries.
- Overhauled Government Reforms. The reforms now mimic the vanilla structure and features, i.e. republics can choose lottery elections, etc. Currently there are a few unique reforms tied to culture/religion. This is just a start, unique stuff related to Warcraft will be continue to be added.
- Overhauled Estates internally, so they aren't tied to the vanilla names. They mostly function the same as before, although the loyalty balance should now be fixed. Privileges and agendas that don't fit in Warcraft have been removed.
- Fixed several province errors.
- Lots of small bugfixes.
- Changed Guild mechanic. You can now patronize a specific Guild via the estate window. This will unlock a unique estate for that Guild and enable their unique diplomatic action. You can re-patronize a different Guild, although this will disable the active Guild.
