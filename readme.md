# WWU

World of Warcraft Universalis is an ambitious project that attempts to recreate the Warcraft universe as we know it so far. We aim to integrate the world of Warcraft seamlessly into the gameplay systems of Europa Universalis 4, creating an unique playing experience. Created by **Jaymez** and **Xylozi**, developed by **vawser** up to *1.22* version and recently was taken over by **Aetherum** since *1.28* version. 
##### It's currently up to date with latest EU4 version, *1.29*.
