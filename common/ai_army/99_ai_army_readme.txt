# Scripts in ai_army can be used to influence how the army AI behaves when certain conditions (Defined in the "active" trigger) are met.
# It is intended not to control daily decision making of armies but to define a general attitude that will influence (or overwrite) hard-coded AI behaviour.
# The "active" trigger (I.e. the trigger that decides what attitude is currently active) is evaluated when any of the following happens:
#  * A war begins or ends
#  * A country gains or loses a province
#  * A year without wars or province changes passes
