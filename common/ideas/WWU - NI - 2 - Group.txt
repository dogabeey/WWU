    # Veterans of the Kaldorei resistance: The Kaldorei Resistance, or night elf resistance, were those who fought against the Burning Legion and the Highborne leaders from the Kaldorei Empire. They were led by Lord Ravencrest.[5] The Resistance consisted of several night elven organizations including the Moon Guard, Sisterhood of Elune, the Rooksguard, and the denizens like the Wild Gods and the dragonflights.The host almost entirely consisted out of night elves at the beginning at the war, but towards the end, thanks to Krasus, tauren, earthen and even furbolgs joined, adding more melee power the night elves needed. They eventually defeated the Burning Legion.

    # The Sundering and the World Tree: Furion and the three dragons made a pact that the night elves would serve as guards of this new well. Alexstrasza brought an enchanted acorn, a remnant of G'hanir, and placed it in the well, where it grew into Nordrassil, the first world tree. This tree would serve as a means to regulate the power of the new Well masking its energies ingeniously from radiating out into the Twisting Nether to serve as another beacon for the Legion. The tree would also mask its power signature from would-be magic users in the hope of preventing any other society from learning arcane secrets and repeating the disastrous error of the elves. The tree would forever serve as a symbol of the connection between the arcane and nature, the night elves and the natural world, and would use the energies from the well to heal the world after the devastation of the Sundering. Partly in reward for their effort in repelling the Legion invasion, Nozdormu then blessed tree, so that, as long as the tree sto    #od, the night elves would never age or fall prey to disease. Ysera also placed an enchantment upon the World Tree by linking the spirits of the night elves to her own realm, the ethereal dimension known as the Emerald Dream. The night elf druids, including Furion himself, were bound to the Dream through the World Tree. As part of the mystical pact, the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of Ysera's Dreamways and the spirits of the night elves. Though the druids were wary of losing so many years of their lives to hibernation, they agreed to uphold their bargain with Ysera

    # The Long Vigil and The ban on the Arcane:Tyrande Whisperwind, high priestess of Elune, had become the leader of the night elf populace. For thousands of years, she led the night elves in their vigil. Much of this time was spent apart from her love, Malfurion Stormrage, who, alongside his fellow druids, upheld the balance of nature from within the Emerald Dream. However, whenever a crisis came, the druids would awaken. One such crisis came from the remaining Highborne. Due to their narrowmindedness over the period of the long vigil the night elves saw little to no major advances

As members of the Alliance, the night elves partook in multiple conflicts.
