 wwu_harmonization.10.title: "Concept of Light"
 wwu_harmonization.10.desc: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate our concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Light with their own beliefs. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Light concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves."

Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of the Light?"
 wwu_harmonization.11.option.a: "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 wwu_harmonization.11.option.b: "This would be a travesty!"

 wwu_harmonization.12.desc: "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their unknown culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."
 wwu_harmonization.12.option.a: "Depose this [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetWomanMan]!"

 wwu_harmonization.13.title: "Rights and Rite"
 wwu_harmonization.13.desc: "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach.

Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
