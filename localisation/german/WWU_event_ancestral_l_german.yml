 wwu_shamanism.1.title: "Passing of Great Leader"
 wwu_shamanism.1.desc: "The previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was a great leader of our people and a legendary figure amongst the [Root.Culture.GetName] rulers. Sadly, they recently fell sick and the elder shamans were unable to prevent their passing.\n\nIn ancestral tradition, we know spirits of great shamans do not leave this world after-life, and sometimes new leaders channel their spirits for guidance. Since they have proven themselves countless of times, we think they deserves a special crypt for their eternal rest. On the other hand, certain statesmen in our council are against it. Some of them do not agree and don't believe the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] deserves such treatment and doing so might offend other spirits."

Dark times are ahead and I shall help you for the sake of our nation."\n\n $MONARCH$ gulped down, experiencing both fear and excitement at the same time.

But I was rewarded with a restless torment in this cursed tomb as return. Your ancestors disrespected my memory. And now, you shall pay for this\n\n $MONARCH$ gulped down, experiencing both fear and excitement at same time. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had to do something: Run or Fight."
