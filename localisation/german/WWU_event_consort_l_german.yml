 wwu_consort.1.t:0 "An Offer of Marriage"
 wwu_consort.1.da:0 "It is with some consternation that the mighty families of the realm have watched [Root.Monarch.GetName] letting the years pass [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by without finding someone to marry. These feelings have now turned into open dismay as despite the realm lacking a clear line of succession our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] appears to have no plans to find a spouse nor is [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] showing much interest the proposals sent to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\nIt has now reached the point where the court is expecting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to accept one of the offers on the table. Continued failure to secure the succession puts the entire realm at risk. Luckily one of the oldest and most prestigious [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] families in the [Root.GovernmentName] has offered us the hand of one of their daughters, along with a generous dowry."
 wwu_consort.1.db:0 "Ruling a great [Root.GovernmentName] can be busy work and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never shied away from that challenge. As the years go by, however, it has become increasingly clear that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not devoting the expected time and effort to find a new consort. While it is reasonable to expect a certain period of mourning that time is now long past.\nIt is high time [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a new spouse. Luckily, when you are a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the high ranking families of the realm are eager to lend a helping hand."
 wwu_consort.1.dc:0 "The stability of a hereditary realm rests on having a clear succession. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] remains an unmarried [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] despite having reached a marriageable age without a clear heir. Some of the finest families in our [Root.GovernmentName] would be overjoyed to help us in this matter and would likely be ready to pay an astronomical dowry for the privilege."
 wwu_consort.1.dd:0 "To have a member of your family be the foremost consort of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is a great honor and one all the influential families of [Root.GetName] covets. In the hopes of securing a lasting alliance leading [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] landholders has sent an offer, and an astronomic dowry, asking that [Root.Monarch.GetName] take their daughters hand in marriage."
 wwu_consort.1.a:0 "Accept the offer."

 wwu_consort.2.d:0 "With the union of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Consort.GetName] we have gained not only a spouse but also a new ally in the realm. The [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] is an old and influential family and their seat in [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] is a jewel of the [Root.GovernmentName].\nOf course friendship has to go both ways and [Root.Consort.GetName] will be expected to speak for [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] kin while our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be expected consider such advice very carefully."

Now that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is the Royal Regent of the realm they are ecstatic. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now one of, if not the, most powerful [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] in the realm and the family has made it very clear to us that they expect to be treated in accordance to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position."
 wwu_consort.5.a:0 "What kind of [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] be if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not help?"

It is also of great importance that the future consort is of suitable status and it is advantageous if she or he is a foreigner, so as not to disturb the balance of internal politics. \n\nHowever, even a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can become lovestruck. Then all such matters seem to melt away - from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] point of view, at least. A local from the [consort_home.GetName] province has caught [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eye. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] appears to be happier than ever, entirely and endlessly enamored. While our nobles and advisors are less than pleased, the union between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] beloved has strong support among the commoners of the realm."

However, rumors bringing these issues to light have recently begun to spread... Some say that the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has refused to let go of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] old [origin_country_of_consort.Religion.GetName] faith - while the people may have understood the need for a marriage with foreigners they are less likely to do so when it comes to being ruled by a heretic."

For all they know [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] could be harboring loyalties towards the old country, or worse - [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] could be a spy! And is it not a funny coincidence, the nobles argue, that the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become so dependent on the advice of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse?\n\nOur military advisor $ARMY_ORGANISER$$ARMY_REFORMER$$COMMANDANT$$GRAND_CAPTAIN$$MASTER_RECRUITER$$MILITARY_ENGINEER$$QUARTERMASTER$ has gone so far as to threaten to leave court if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not distance [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] from the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] and [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] untrustworthy whispers."
