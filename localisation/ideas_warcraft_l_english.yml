 mantid_ideas_1: "Voice of the Empress"
 mantid_ideas_1_desc: "We are the extension of our Empress's will. Ours is but to serve in Her divine name. Never to question, nor to contemplate; we simply act. We fight, toil, and serve so that Her vision for us is made reality. Her happiness is our reward, her sorrow our failure. We will give our lives for the Empress without hesitation. She is the light, and without Her our lives will be lost to darkness."
 mantid_ideas_2: "The Mantid Swarm"
 mantid_ideas_2_desc:  "We mantid are an elder race. The pandaren you associate with - they are but children. They have their role to play. Each cycle, our young swarm their walls. The pandaren slay the weak. The strong return. With each generation, we grow ever stronger."

 mantid_ideas_5: "The Kunchong Cycle"
 mantid_ideas_5_desc:  "The cycle of mantid birthing and building revolves around the kunchong, a colossal insect large enough to threaten whole towns by itself.

"
 mantid_ideas_6: "Sonic Technology"
 mantid_ideas_6_desc: "Masters of sound, the mantid long ago found a way to use amber to extend the range of their acoustic casting. In this way they are able to communicate over vast distances. No army has successfully marched on mantid lands undetected, and even lone travellers are urged caution as their movements are no doubt being watched the moment they venture beyond the wall."
