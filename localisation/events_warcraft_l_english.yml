Defying both Legion and his ancestors, Nerzhul opened a portal many worlds across the cosmos and eventually tore whole Dreanor apart!\n\nUpon escaping via one of these portals, Ner'zhul quickly was captured by Kil'jaeden and his followers were killed. Now a prisoner of The Burning Legion, Ner'zhul's entire body and soul was torn apart by Kil'jaeden himself. Under unspeakable torture, Ner'zhul accepted to serve under Legion once again but secrely he plotted for vengeance. His spirit was placed within a specially crafted block of diamond-hard ice gathered from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether. Encased within the frozen cask, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand fold. Warped by the demon's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul became a spectral being of unfathomable power. At that moment, the orc known as Ner'zhul was shattered forever, and the Lich King was born.\n\nWhen Kil'jaeden cast Ner'zhul's icy cask back into the world of Azeroth, the hardened crystal streaked across the night sky and smashed into the desolate arctic continent of Northrend, burying itself deep within the Icecrown glacier. The frozen crystal, warped and scarred by its violent descent, came to resemble a throne, and Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit soon stirred within it. From the confines of the Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul began to reach out his vast consciousness and touch the minds of Northrend's native inhabitants."

Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that the Sejm approved a monarch who speaks their language.

 kingdom_of_magic.14.d:0 "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Sejm for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty.

 kingdom_of_magic.15.d:0 "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Sejm's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations.

To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place.

A member of the dynasty has now been suggested to be the rightful ruler of not only [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s homeland, but ours as well.\n\nWhether or not this claim will be pushed through war or is merely used to bolster the foreign monarch's status for a domestic power struggle remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility of being forced into a union in this manner is ominous."

 kingdom_of_magic.19.d:0 "Our support for [From.Monarch.GetName], our candidate for the [From.GetAdjective] throne, has yielded us many diplomatic advantages since [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] was elected. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family's claims on [From.GetName] reaches beyond this single individual and that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should in fact be considered the ruler of both [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName].\n\n[From.Monarch.GetName] considers [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] sovereign, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] outranks [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the dynasty.
