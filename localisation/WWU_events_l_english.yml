Defying both Legion and his ancestors, Nerzhul opened a portal many worlds across the cosmos and eventually tore whole Dreanor apart!\n\nUpon escaping via one of these portals, Ner'zhul quickly was captured by Kil'jaeden and his followers were killed. Now a prisoner of The Burning Legion, Ner'zhul's entire body and soul was torn apart by Kil'jaeden himself. Under unspeakable torture, Ner'zhul accepted to serve under Legion once again but secrely he plotted for vengeance. His spirit was placed within a specially crafted block of diamond-hard ice gathered from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether. Encased within the frozen cask, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand fold. Warped by the demon's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul became a spectral being of unfathomable power. At that moment, the orc known as Ner'zhul was shattered forever, and the Lich King was born.\n\nWhen Kil'jaeden cast Ner'zhul's icy cask back into the world of Azeroth, the hardened crystal streaked across the night sky and smashed into the desolate arctic continent of Northrend, burying itself deep within the Icecrown glacier. The frozen crystal, warped and scarred by its violent descent, came to resemble a throne, and Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit soon stirred within it. From the confines of the Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul began to reach out his vast consciousness and touch the minds of Northrend's native inhabitants."

 kingdom_of_magic.5.d: "We have discovered that the government of $FROM$ has given tacit support to an assassination plot against our candidate for their throne. This is a grievous insult against our country and must be answered!"
 kingdom_of_magic.5.a: "Fiends!"
 kingdom_of_magic.6.t: "Religious Differences"
 kingdom_of_magic.6.d: "While our nation naturally belongs to the true [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we are backing a member of our dynasty to succeed to the throne in a country that follows a misguided heretical faith. That country has now placed a demand on our candidate to convert to their religion if he is to be allowed to take the throne."

Though we suspect the accident was in fact a cunning assassination carried out by backers of a different candidate, we have no proof and all our hard work to place our dynasty on the $FROM_ADJ$ throne is undone."
 kingdom_of_magic.7.a: "Awful!"
 kingdom_of_magic.8.t: "The Blood of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Unites"
 kingdom_of_magic.8.d: "Although [Root.GetName] is sometimes weakened by the external influence on our politics, electing a monarch from another nation has created a bond of trust and allowed for unique diplomatic opportunities. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made excellent use of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family's influence abroad and strengthened ties to the place our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] once called home."
 kingdom_of_magic.8.a: "Let us hope they last."
 kingdom_of_magic.9.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Inherits Title"
 kingdom_of_magic.9.d: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] first and foremost, [Root.Monarch.GetName] still has the right to some titles in the land from which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hails. While foreigners might have supported [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ascent to the throne with hopes of ruling over us, having a rightful claim on a title in their lands may well give us a chance to do the reverse..."
 kingdom_of_magic.9.a: "It is [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] birthright!"
 kingdom_of_magic.9.b: "We have no ulterior motives with our choice."
 kingdom_of_magic.10.t: "Sejm Forces Abdication"
 kingdom_of_magic.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Sejm. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favor of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 kingdom_of_magic.10.a: "Absolutely. Absolutism must be avoided."
 kingdom_of_magic.10.b: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can't bow so easily to nobles!"
 kingdom_of_magic.11.t: "The [Root.Religion.GetName] Convert"
 kingdom_of_magic.11.d: "The world is seeing turbulent religious change. A monarch shifting religious allegiance can be seen as a powerful trend, and when [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith on ascending to the throne, many took note. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could convert, what is stopping the other unenlightened from seeing the truth? Nothing, its supporters argue. The pressure on everyone, noble or commoner, who has not yet fallen into line is now higher than ever."
 kingdom_of_magic.11.a: "Let us hope they see reason, or at least faith."
 kingdom_of_magic.12.t: "Overambitious Campaign"
 kingdom_of_magic.12.d: "The aggressive war [Root.Monarch.GetName] has undertaken is not progressing well. This is always a cause for unrest, but particularly so when the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is a foreigner. Over the course of the war, people have started to claim that [Root.GetName] is a peaceful nation and that this foolhardy monarch is bringing it to ruin."
 kingdom_of_magic.12.a: "The war has only begun! Onward!"
 kingdom_of_magic.12.b: "We must try to end the conflict quickly."
 kingdom_of_magic.13.t: "Like Home"
 kingdom_of_magic.13.d: "Being of [Root.Culture.GetName] birth, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] often visits [Root.GetName]. Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that the Sejm approved a monarch who speaks their language. A recent visit has considerably improved the locals' impression of the administration."
 kingdom_of_magic.13.a: "There was no reason to ever doubt it."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.t: "Loyalties of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 kingdom_of_magic.14.d: "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Sejm for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Although they hopefully understand that they can't rule our nation forever, they are beginning to ask questions about how this will affect future cooperation between us."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.a: "Assure them that the Sejm stays loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.b: "Admit that a shift is necessary."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.c: "Stay neutral. The Sejm owes allegiance only to [Root.GetName]."
 kingdom_of_magic.15.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Sejm Shifts Allegiance"
 kingdom_of_magic.15.d: "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Sejm's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations. When pressured, [From.GetName] has made it clear that the times are changing, and that they are trying to avoid another monarch from [Root.GetName]."
 kingdom_of_magic.15.a: "Fickle [From.GetAdjective] nobles!"
 kingdom_of_magic.16.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Sejm Turns to Us"
 kingdom_of_magic.16.d: "[From.GetName] has been under pressure from the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to maintain the bloodline's hold of their throne, but the Sejm has spoken against them, in our favor. [From.Heir.GetName], already having popular support in the Sejm, is now considered their primary candidate for escaping the dynasty's grip and avoiding an absolutist monarch."
 kingdom_of_magic.16.a: "[From.Heir.GetSheHeCap] will lead them to freedom... or at least to us."
 kingdom_of_magic.17.t: "Golden Liberty"
 kingdom_of_magic.17.d: "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Sejm."
 kingdom_of_magic.17.a: "They were wise to elect us. Let us listen to them."
 kingdom_of_magic.17.b: "We must wrest control of this anarchy!"
 kingdom_of_magic.18.t: "[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Family Gains Claim on [Root.GetAdjective] Throne"
 kingdom_of_magic.18.d: "Recent power shifts among the foreign relatives of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and clashing inheritance laws have led to an unfortunate situation with the house of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. A member of the dynasty has now been suggested to be the rightful ruler of not only [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s homeland, but ours as well.\n\nWhether or not this claim will be pushed through war or is merely used to bolster the foreign monarch's status for a domestic power struggle remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility of being forced into a union in this manner is ominous."
 kingdom_of_magic.18.a: "We elected one of theirs as a show of good faith!"
 kingdom_of_magic.19.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Gains Claim on [From.GetAdjective] Throne"
 kingdom_of_magic.19.d: "Our support for [From.Monarch.GetName], our candidate for the [From.GetAdjective] throne, has yielded us many diplomatic advantages since [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] was elected. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family's claims on [From.GetName] reaches beyond this single individual and that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should in fact be considered the ruler of both [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName].\n\n[From.Monarch.GetName] considers [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] sovereign, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] outranks [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the dynasty. Surely a [From.Monarch.GetTitle]'s first loyalty must be to family, must it not?"
 kingdom_of_magic.19.a: "An intriguing line of thought..."

These rumors are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins.

 wwu_tribes.11.title: "Ruinous Games"
 wwu_tribes.11.desc: "Oh horrors! As the war games started, two members of feuding clans started a squabble that got out of control and turned into massive brawl. Before our palace guards could stop them, the arena pit was damaged, and two large pagodas set on fire, ruining the rest of this event!"

 wwu_tribes.12.title: "Legendary Games"
 wwu_tribes.12.desc: "The whole event went better than we could ever have hoped for!

So impressed were our elders, that after the event even the oldest among them could not remember a more successful games!"

 wwu_tribes.13.title: "Clansmen Flock our Hosts"
 wwu_tribes.13.desc: "Hearing the rumors that our mighty hosts are being depleted of manpower young warriors emerge from the deepest parts of our realm, flocking into our armies. Some seek the life of nomadic warriors and mercenaries, others merely the loot."
 wwu_tribes.13.option.a: "May the sons join their fathers."
 
 wwu_tribes.14.title: "Restless Warband"
 wwu_tribes.14.desc: "Enraged with the current state of peace and lack of raiding and looting an entire clan, comprised mostly of highly experienced warriors and huntsmen has left our horde and went on to join one of our neighbors instead."

 wwu_tribes.17.title: "Tribal Feud"
 wwu_tribes.17.desc: "During the height of the summer festivities in our capital members of two feuding tribes have decided to have a public showdown and fight it out in front of the entire political and religious leadership of our state! The ensuing violence was so fierce that not only the feuding tribesmen lost their lives, but also countless bystanders and even members of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s guard."

The survivor, though wounded by a poison arrow, lived long enough to tell us of a valiant last stand of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Tall and mighty he stood, cutting the creatures of the night one by one as they surrounded him, until the last of his body guards succumbed. Shaken and in mourning, our people celebrate the legacy of [Root.Heir.GetName] as he achieves immortality in their memory."

 wwu_tribes.24.option.a: "Yes, indeed."

 # Corruption
 #-----------------------------------------------
 wwu_corruption.1.title: "The Honest Merchants of [Root.GetName]"
 wwu_corruption.1.desc: "While many traders are known for cheating countrymen and foreigners alike, lying about the quality of goods and making fraudulent promises, [Root.GetAdjective] merchants are well known to be trustworthy, if competitive. Although they may sometimes cut deals that benefit themselves and not their trade partners, they rarely lie or take bribes. This has made us the first choice of traders around the world."
 wwu_corruption.1.option.a: "Why would we lie when we have the best offers?"
 
 wwu_corruption.2.title: "Trust Your Neighbor"
 wwu_corruption.2.desc: "Although citizens are encouraged to show trust and good faith in their exchanges, the reality in many nations is that it's a risk people cannot afford to take. This, however, is not the case in [Root.GetName]. We have successfully stamped out corruption on so many levels in society, people not only trust officials to do their jobs without the extra help of a bribe but they also trust each other more in general exchanges. This general belief in the honesty of others is the very thread from which the fabric of society is woven, and our country is a shining example of it."
 wwu_corruption.2.option.a: "As stipulated in [Root.Religion.GetName] teachings."
 
 wwu_corruption.3.title: "Rigorous Researchers"
 wwu_corruption.3.desc: "Academic institutions are not immune to corruption, and the profits that can be made by abusing positions of great influence can stand in the way of creating a good environment for research. However, [Root.GetAdjective] scientists are largely above this, focusing on genuine intellectual achievements above titles and financial contributions. The lack of corruption in society allows us to explore and invent without being impeded by selfish interests."
 wwu_corruption.3.option.a: "The search for knowledge must be valued in itself."
 
 wwu_corruption.4.title: "An Honorable People"
 wwu_corruption.4.desc: "Few are the countries in the world who do not claim to value honor and justice, but even fewer are the countries who actually live up to these ideals. However, the lack of large-scale and everyday corruption in [Root.GetName] has made it one of these rare places where principles matter over personal gain. Even abroad, [Root.GetAdjective] expatriates are sought-after for positions of trust, as our people are known for adherence to duty and rejecting attempted bribes. Who else can claim to live up to these ideals?"
 wwu_corruption.4.option.a: "Few indeed."
 
 wwu_corruption.5.title: "Incorruptible"
 wwu_corruption.5.desc: "Not everyone who aids the enemy knows the true nature of their transgression. Spies may be loyal to a foreign power, but many of their information sources are people who are simply paid well for telling secrets they shouldn't, without understanding who makes use of them. However, in [Root.GetName], corruption has been all but extinguished. Spies who recently tried to compromise our administration through bribery and extortion have found themselves reported instead of aided by our officials, and are now at our mercy."
 wwu_corruption.5.option.a: "Death to spies!"
 
 wwu_corruption.6.title: "Corrupt Taxmen"
 wwu_corruption.6.desc: "Those who handle large sums of money have always been tempted to claim more than their share of it, and tax collectors are no exception. However, while money getting lost along the way may be a price we can afford to pay, affluent citizens have now found that they can avoid some taxes altogether by paying large bribes to taxmen instead. Currently this seems to be a scheme supported by some of the older collectors trying to retire comfortably. While it is costly, we might be able to avoid spending time and effort on a detailed investigation and just wait it out."
 wwu_corruption.6.option.a: "Investigate and replace them immediately."
 wwu_corruption.6.option.b: "Let them retire, they've served us well in the past."
 
 wwu_corruption.7.title: "Corrupt Advisor"
 wwu_corruption.7.d: "[Root.GetName] may be plagued by corruption, but we try to ensure that those closest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can be trusted, at the very least. Try and fail, it seems, since one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors, [Root.GetEventAdvisorName], was recently caught taking large bribes from people already wielding great influence in our country to provide the government with advice slanted to advance their interests. How shall we respond to this betrayal?"
 wwu_corruption.7.option.a: "Publicly expose these lies and prepare an execution."
 wwu_corruption.7.option.b: "Arrange for a quiet retirement in house arrest."
 wwu_corruption.7.option.c: "A reprimand. Biased advice is still advice."
 
 wwu_corruption.8.title: "Wily Smugglers"
 wwu_corruption.8.desc: "Smuggling is an activity even the most simple-minded can decide to pursue - the only difference is that they get caught. More worrying are those with genuine talent in knowing who to bribe and what lies to tell to elude capture, and as smuggling becomes more profitable, these tend to grow in numbers.\n\nWe have been on the trail of a particularly clever band of smugglers recently, and the network of deceit they have managed to create to continue their operations continues to surprise us. How should we go about resolving this?"
 wwu_corruption.8.option.a: "Send our best men to track down their collaborators."
 wwu_corruption.8.option.b: "Send an agent to recruit them as spies."
 wwu_corruption.8.option.c: "Ignore them for the time being."
 
 wwu_corruption.9.title: "[culture_province.Culture.GetName] Community Distrusts Us"
 wwu_corruption.9.desc: "[Root.GetName] may not house the most egregious liars and traitors in the world, but compared to some other countries, our people do tend to be a bit more easily bribed into abusing their authority. Most of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] population accepts the difficulties and, to the dishonest, occasional benefits this brings.\n\nThe [culture_province.Culture.GetName] people in [culture_province.GetName] see things differently. They lament this state of things as a consequence of letting the easily corrupted [Root.Culture.GetName] people rule the nation, claiming that the country ruled by their own people doesn't suffer the same fate. Some of them are suggesting that they would be better off seceding."
 wwu_corruption.9.option.a: "Apologize for our failure and promise to improve."
 wwu_corruption.9.option.b: "Reject this as uneducated prejudice."
 
 wwu_corruption.10.title: "Corrupt Ambassador"
 wwu_corruption.10.desc: "Our representatives to other countries should represent our very best people, but unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes people are given posts as ambassadors because the administration wants them far away, and at worst, there is good reason for this.\n\nAs it turns out, one such ambassador has spent his well-paid exile further enriching himself with bribes. While this is not exactly improving our reputation with the locals, he has maintained important connections here at home and will not be dismissed without causing some trouble."
 wwu_corruption.10.option.a: "He has caused more trouble where he is. Get rid of him."
 wwu_corruption.10.option.b: "They'll have to get used to it."
 
 wwu_corruption.11.title: "[trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] 'Disappearing'"
 wwu_corruption.11.d: "With corruption ever on the rise in [Root.GetName], an increasing amount of [trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] has been disappearing from our legitimate trade networks onto the black market. While some blame too restrictive regulations and tariffs, part of the problem is clearly that these crimes are simply too easy to get away with. When silence is easily bought, secrets are easy to keep, and those secrets are growing more and more costly for [Root.GetName]."
 wwu_corruption.11.option.a: "We must regain control of the [trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] market."
 
 wwu_corruption.12.title: "Corrupt Generals"
 wwu_corruption.12.desc: "Military experience and expertise should be the main, if not only, factors influencing who rises through the ranks of the [Root.GetAdjective] army. As our society grew more and more corrupt, practices drew further and further away from this ideal. The reality today is that a position as general carries a lot of prestige, and those with money or connections are more than willing to use them to secure such a position. With the existing leadership being easily influenced with these tools, they can.\n\nFrom time to time, someone may rise through the ranks who have actually earned their title, but many of the finest minds in strategic matters will never have a chance to lend their skills to us."
 wwu_corruption.12.option.a: "Such an unjust world."
 
 wwu_corruption.13.title: "Corrupt Admirals"
 wwu_corruption.13.desc: "Those who command our ships in battle or are sent to explore lands to be claimed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be chosen from the bravest and wisest in our navy. This is not the case today. From their very first day on a ship, sailors see money illicitly changing hands and protocol being broken as a matter of course, and quickly learn that both the letter and the spirit of the law carry little weight in [Root.GetName] when silver is put on the other pan of the scales.\n\nThose who do not learn quickly make enemies. To advance through the ranks of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy, you need to learn to play this system, and those who rise to the top are rarely those we wished would be there."
 wwu_corruption.13.option.a: "No wonder we have mutinies."
 
 wwu_corruption.14.title: "Foreign Merchants Distrust Us"
 wwu_corruption.14.desc: "Every trader tries to cut a deal that will be to their benefit, and many are willing to bend the truth a little to succeed. While this is expected, merchants from [Root.GetName] have a reputation abroad that goes beyond this into outright lies and fraud. The corruption which has become a part of how we do business can be shocking to outsiders, which has led to traders worldwide choosing to avoid us when possible.\n\nIt's too late to do anything about our present image, as the damage is already done, but perhaps we can stop this from reoccurring if we stamp out the casual corruption in our society."
 wwu_corruption.14.option.a: "We're not dishonest, just pragmatic!"
 
 wwu_corruption.15.title: "Governmental Functions Breaking Down"
 wwu_corruption.15.desc: "A corrupt administration operates less to sustain itself and more to sustain its members. Consequently, as it begins to fall apart, the immediate reaction of most officials is not to save what they all stand to lose, but to grab what they can while it lasts.\n\n[Root.GetName] may not be on its way to a complete collapse, but the severe corruption reaching all the way from the lowest clerk to those closest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has corroded several crucial governmental functions, leading to a widespread destabilization of the country. This has been a long time coming and we all pay the price."
 wwu_corruption.15.option.a: "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 
 wwu_corruption.16.title: "Mercenaries Extorting Locals"
 wwu_corruption.16.d: "During wartime, soldiers of fortune often find ways to make it home with a bit more than they are paid by raiding the land where they are sent to fight. Normally, this is not a problem for us when they are sent abroad to terrorize our enemies, but sometimes this habit is hard to break, even during peacetime. Some farmers and travelers in [hired_mercs_victim_area.GetAreaName] have complained that the [hired_merc_band.GetName], a mercenary band in our employ stationed there, have been robbing and extorting them, despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that there isn't even a war ongoing.\n\nMeddling in the ranks of mercenaries, even ones that we hired, is always a difficult matter. Their accusers are unlikely to take the matter further if we let it slide, but the question remains as to how our society will change if we allow such extortion to continue."
 wwu_corruption.16.option.a: "Purge the mercenary ranks of such thugs."
 wwu_corruption.16.option.b: "It's part of the price our country pays for their service."
 
 wwu_corruption.17.title: "Incompetent Administrator"
 wwu_corruption.17.desc: "Matters of governmental organization have never been [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s strong suit. What a good leader does to compensate for such a known weakness is to delegate and this is exactly what our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has done, but the people who have handled administration in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stead have proven to be more competent than honest. The government runs well enough, but tends to slowly shift its priorities towards matters which the benefactors of these irreplaceable officials find to be of importance.\n\nWith [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to fully grasp the intricacies of the matters in question, the guilty parties cannot easily be seen or removed from office. For now, we'll simply have to suffer the consequences."
 wwu_corruption.17.option.a: "Unfortunate that skill and honor do not always go hand in hand."
 
 wwu_corruption.18.title: "Overextension Exploited"
 wwu_corruption.18.desc: "The rapid expansion of the [Root.GetAdjective] borders is most fortunate, but brings with it new administrative challenges. As every person familiar with the optimistic language knows, "challenges" is the sweeter-tasting word for "problems". Our country has not fully adjusted to its new extent yet, and people who have noticed the confusion and poorly enforced law in these new acquisitions are reaping the benefits.\n\nThis lawlessness may eventually pass, but the temporary administrations appear to have built an unstable foundation for the future. It will take time and money to rid our society of the distrust forming in the present situation."
 wwu_corruption.18.option.a: "We'll have to adapt as best we can."
 
 wwu_corruption.19.title: "$TRADER$ Has Corrupt Connections"
 wwu_corruption.19.desc: "We try to keep our administration free of dishonest individuals, but we cannot always account for the friends and contacts which got them to where they are. $TRADER$ has unfortunately turned out to be a good example of the problems that follow from this, being skilled and personable but somewhat gullible in $TRADER_POSS_PRONOUN$ choice of associates.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed that much of our well-built trade network relies on bribes, smuggling, and other dubious activities to reach its current level of efficiency. $TRADER$ claims to have known nothing of this, which is likely true. Nevertheless, if we decide to expose and end this, the responsibility will be $TRADER_POSS_PRONOUN$ to take."
 wwu_corruption.19.option.a: "Failure to see through lies is also a failure."
 wwu_corruption.19.option.b: "If it works, it works."
 
 wwu_corruption.20.title: "Bribes Growing More Accepted"
 wwu_corruption.20.desc: "'What is the difference between an honest man and a fool? The fool doesn't know he is being swindled.'\n\nSo goes an increasingly common saying in [Root.GetName], the spirit of which is proven through a more sinister change in the social fabric. Bribes are beginning to be seen as a natural consequence of the market, where any action carries a price. Those who refuse to take bribes are viewed as precisely what the saying suggests: fools. Worse than fools, since they are deliberately refusing money that could be theirs. The consequence of this cynicism is that any form of power truly corrupts, and no one who believes it is immune. Not even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 wwu_corruption.20.option.a: "It's still just a saying."
