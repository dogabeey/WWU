Now a prisoner of The Burning Legion, Ner'zhul's entire body and soul was torn apart by Kil'jaeden himself. Under unspeakable torture, Ner'zhul accepted to serve under Legion once again but secrely he plotted for vengeance. His spirit was placed within a specially crafted block of diamond-hard ice gathered from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether. Encased within the frozen cask, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand fold. Warped by the demon's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul became a spectral being of unfathomable power. At that moment, the orc known as Ner'zhul was shattered forever, and the Lich King was born.\n\nWhen Kil'jaeden cast Ner'zhul's icy cask back into the world of Azeroth, the hardened crystal streaked across the night sky and smashed into the desolate arctic continent of Northrend, burying itself deep within the Icecrown glacier. The frozen crystal, warped and scarred by its violent descent, came to resemble a throne, and Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit soon stirred within it. From the confines of the Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul began to reach out his vast consciousness and touch the minds of Northrend's native inhabitants."

Though we suspect the accident was in fact a cunning assassination carried out by backers of a different candidate, we have no proof and all our hard work to place our dynasty on the $FROM_ADJ$ throne is undone."
 kingdom_of_magic.7.a: "Awful!"
 kingdom_of_magic.8.t: "The Blood of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Unites"
 kingdom_of_magic.8.d: "Although [Root.GetName] is sometimes weakened by the external influence on our politics, electing a monarch from another nation has created a bond of trust and allowed for unique diplomatic opportunities. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made excellent use of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family's influence abroad and strengthened ties to the place our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] once called home."
 kingdom_of_magic.8.a: "Let us hope they last."
 kingdom_of_magic.9.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Inherits Title"
 kingdom_of_magic.9.d: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] first and foremost, [Root.Monarch.GetName] still has the right to some titles in the land from which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hails. While foreigners might have supported [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ascent to the throne with hopes of ruling over us, having a rightful claim on a title in their lands may well give us a chance to do the reverse..."
 kingdom_of_magic.9.a: "It is [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] birthright!"
 kingdom_of_magic.9.b: "We have no ulterior motives with our choice."
 kingdom_of_magic.10.t: "Sejm Forces Abdication"
 kingdom_of_magic.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Sejm. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favor of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 kingdom_of_magic.10.a: "Absolutely. Absolutism must be avoided."
 kingdom_of_magic.10.b: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can't bow so easily to nobles!"
 kingdom_of_magic.11.t: "The [Root.Religion.GetName] Convert"
 kingdom_of_magic.11.d: "The world is seeing turbulent religious change. A monarch shifting religious allegiance can be seen as a powerful trend, and when [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith on ascending to the throne, many took note. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could convert, what is stopping the other unenlightened from seeing the truth? Nothing, its supporters argue. The pressure on everyone, noble or commoner, who has not yet fallen into line is now higher than ever."
 kingdom_of_magic.11.a: "Let us hope they see reason, or at least faith."
 kingdom_of_magic.12.t: "Overambitious Campaign"
 kingdom_of_magic.12.d: "The aggressive war [Root.Monarch.GetName] has undertaken is not progressing well. This is always a cause for unrest, but particularly so when the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is a foreigner. Over the course of the war, people have started to claim that [Root.GetName] is a peaceful nation and that this foolhardy monarch is bringing it to ruin."
 kingdom_of_magic.12.a: "The war has only begun! Onward!"
 kingdom_of_magic.12.b: "We must try to end the conflict quickly."
 kingdom_of_magic.13.t: "Like Home"
 kingdom_of_magic.13.d: "Being of [Root.Culture.GetName] birth, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] often visits [Root.GetName]. Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that the Sejm approved a monarch who speaks their language. A recent visit has considerably improved the locals' impression of the administration."
 kingdom_of_magic.13.a: "There was no reason to ever doubt it."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.t: "Loyalties of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 kingdom_of_magic.14.d: "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Sejm for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Although they hopefully understand that they can't rule our nation forever, they are beginning to ask questions about how this will affect future cooperation between us."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.a: "Assure them that the Sejm stays loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.b: "Admit that a shift is necessary."
 kingdom_of_magic.14.c: "Stay neutral. The Sejm owes allegiance only to [Root.GetName]."
 kingdom_of_magic.15.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Sejm Shifts Allegiance"
 kingdom_of_magic.15.d: "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Sejm's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations. When pressured, [From.GetName] has made it clear that the times are changing, and that they are trying to avoid another monarch from [Root.GetName]."
 kingdom_of_magic.15.a: "Fickle [From.GetAdjective] nobles!"
 kingdom_of_magic.16.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Sejm Turns to Us"
 kingdom_of_magic.16.d: "[From.GetName] has been under pressure from the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to maintain the bloodline's hold of their throne, but the Sejm has spoken against them, in our favor. [From.Heir.GetName], already having popular support in the Sejm, is now considered their primary candidate for escaping the dynasty's grip and avoiding an absolutist monarch."
 kingdom_of_magic.16.a: "[From.Heir.GetSheHeCap] will lead them to freedom... or at least to us."
 kingdom_of_magic.17.t: "Golden Liberty"
 kingdom_of_magic.17.d: "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Sejm."
 kingdom_of_magic.17.a: "They were wise to elect us. Let us listen to them."
 kingdom_of_magic.17.b: "We must wrest control of this anarchy!"
 kingdom_of_magic.18.t: "[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Family Gains Claim on [Root.GetAdjective] Throne"
 kingdom_of_magic.18.d: "Recent power shifts among the foreign relatives of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and clashing inheritance laws have led to an unfortunate situation with the house of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. A member of the dynasty has now been suggested to be the rightful ruler of not only [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s homeland, but ours as well.\n\nWhether or not this claim will be pushed through war or is merely used to bolster the foreign monarch's status for a domestic power struggle remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility of being forced into a union in this manner is ominous."
 kingdom_of_magic.18.a: "We elected one of theirs as a show of good faith!"
 kingdom_of_magic.19.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Gains Claim on [From.GetAdjective] Throne"
 kingdom_of_magic.19.d: "Our support for [From.Monarch.GetName], our candidate for the [From.GetAdjective] throne, has yielded us many diplomatic advantages since [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] was elected. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family's claims on [From.GetName] reaches beyond this single individual and that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should in fact be considered the ruler of both [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName].\n\n[From.Monarch.GetName] considers [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] sovereign, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] outranks [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the dynasty. Surely a [From.Monarch.GetTitle]'s first loyalty must be to family, must it not?"
 kingdom_of_magic.19.a: "An intriguing line of thought..."

These rumors are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins.
