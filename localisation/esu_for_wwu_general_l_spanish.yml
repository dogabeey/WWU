 #Positive personalities
 mf_positive_personality.EVTNAME1: "A Diamond in the Rough"
 mf_positive_personality.EVTDESC1: "While inspecting our armies, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], thanks to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] keen eye for talent, identified one remarkable individual who [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] believed possessed great potential. Upon summoning him to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] residence, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] became certain of this soldier's ability. The only question that remains concerns what capacity this individual shall serve in our state."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTA1: "Let him reform our armies."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTB1: "Let him organize our ranks."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTC1: "Let him drill our soldiers."
 mf_positive_personality.EVTNAME2: "Banquet for a Neighbor"
 mf_positive_personality.EVTDESC2: "During one of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s usual extravagant parties, a certain [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] of the neighboring nation of [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.TAG.GetName] was also invited to the banquet. Fortunately for us, the gold that would be typically wasted in such a banquet as this was put to good use, as [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] was very pleased with our lavish display and high quality of food, and the [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] is sure to attend our banquets again in the future... should our relations remain friendly, of course." 
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTA2: "Tell [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetSheHe] is welcome here."
 
 #Negative personalities
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME1: "Suspected Bastard?"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC1: "Rumors around the court say that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s consort has been unfaithful to him. These rumors are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins. Although it is not certain that he is a bastard child, the rumors of our consort have already convinced many that it is so... and, unfortunately, some evidence does indeed line up in support of this rumour. All we can do now is accept the child as our heir or deny him the right of succession."   
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA1: "Tis only court gossip..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB1: "No bastard shall be an heir of mine!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC1: "We can allay their suspicions."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME2: "An Inferior Castle"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC2: "Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears regarding our rival's grand castle. Our diplomats report that their castle's impressive size and beauty impress all ambassadors who arrive at its gates. While this has little to do with the actual defenses of the castle, it seems that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become greatly irritated from this news; in fact, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has already begun drafting a new castle."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA2: "This cannot stand!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB2: "A few additions shouldn't hurt..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC2: "Trivial things must be ignored."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME3: "A Lax Military"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC3: "The kind and easygoing nature of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has caused our armies to become soft and lax, and even some of our finest generals are falling into the trap of luxury and indulgence. While this sort of easygoing personality is what allows our soldiers to be fully content and completely loyal to our state, it will bring great harm to our military power and efficiency in battle. Therefore, drastic measures must be taken to whip our armies back into shape."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA3: "Something must be done!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB3: "It can't be helped..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC3: "Surely, we can do much more!"

 #Personality Desc
 desc_jack_of_all_trades_personality: "Jack of all trades, master of none. This ruler dabbles in most spheres of knowledge, enough to rule fairly well, but does not excel in any particular skill. Such a ruler is aware of their limits, and will declare war only when victory is likely."
 desc_renaissance_man_personality: "This ruler is a Classical Man. Significantly well-versed and skilled in numerous subjects, a Classical Man rules extraordinarily well in all aspects and is open to learning new ideas and institutions to add them to his arsenal of expertise." 
 desc_renaissance_woman_personality: "This ruler is a Classical Woman. Significantly well-versed and skilled in numerous subjects, a Classical Woman rules extraordinarily well in all aspects and is open to learning new ideas and institutions to add them to his arsenal of expertise." 
 desc_ambitious_personality: "This ruler is Ambitious. Aiming for bigger fish, this ruler will be less likely to bother declaring war against weaker nations and instead target stronger ones. With such lofty goals, other nations will be less willing to aid our ruler, as they fear the idea of an ambitious ruler becoming too powerful." 
 desc_chaste_personality: "This ruler is Chaste. Pure and restrained, our ruler is unlikely to fool around in extramarital affairs. Keeping all vows, our ruler has built up good karma and even recognition from the Church for their loyalty at the home and the court."
 desc_filially_pious_personality: "This ruler is Filially Pious. Our ruler is virtuous and holds great respect for their ancestors and elders despite occupying the highest position of the state. Their reputation of humility and filial piety is known far and wide, being compared even to the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars."
 desc_crusader_personality: "This ruler is a Crusader. Eager to wage war against heathens, this fanatic ruler also has the military skills to back it up. However, a Crusader will choose to brandish a sword over a Bible, and is thus more likely to violently attack those of other faiths than attempt to convert them."
 desc_bishamonten_personality: "This ruler is known as Bishamonten. The forgotten god of warriors, 'Bishamonten' has been associated with our ruler by both allies and enemies. Knowledgeable in the art of war and fighting in the frontlines, our ruler also values honor above all else and refuses to take advantage of enemies in their time of weakness."
 desc_farr_gifted_personality: "This ruler is endowed with the Farr. In Persian tradition, a ruler is granted the Farr from Gods by ruling justly and fighting valiantly, in effect giving our ruler the divine right to rule and justifying their conquests. Thus, our legitimacy and stability shall benefit much from it."
 desc_peaceful_trader_personality: "This ruler is a Peaceful Trader. Preferring to gain power through skill in trade and coin, a Peaceful Trader is less likely to declare war and has a lacking military as a result. However, other countries are also less likely to declare war on a Peaceful Trader due to the trade benefits they mutually enjoy."
 desc_expert_propagandist_personality: "This ruler is an Expert Propagandist. Skillfully controlling the minds of the public in his favor, our ruler ensures the loyalty of the people. To maintain an image of military might, an Expert Propagandist is eager to declare wars in which victory is guaranteed."
 desc_gregarious_personality: "This ruler is Gregarious. Comfortable in most social situations, this ruler's sociable and pleasant exterior earns the trust of foreign ambassadors, and our ruler always knows how to entertain a crowd. Such a ruler also has the benefit of a larger inner circle in the court."
 desc_sotapanna_personality: "This ruler is an Enlightened. Having seen the Truth, this ruler is considered to have entered the first of the four stages of Enlightenment. Such a reputation means our country will always be in good karma, and a ruler who is on the path to Heaven is also much less likely to engage in any offensive war." 
 desc_spiritual_personality: "This ruler is Spiritual. Wholly, and holy, dedicated to their religion, they are much more likely to tolerate their true faith within their country. As a result, they are much more sceptical of offers of goodwill from those who claim to be religious while straying from the true faith."
 desc_keen_recruiter_personality: "This ruler is a Keen Recruiter. Possessing a sharp eye for detecting talent, such a ruler is much more likely to obtain a skilled leader from the crowd. As a result, a Keen Recruiter will always end up with a general of some skill no matter the draw."
 desc_talented_poet_personality: "This ruler is a Talented Poet. Possessing skills outside of the court, our ruler's prestige is known throughout the land for their splendid way with words. Such a ruler will surely be known in the annals of history for being more than simply a ruler atop a throne."
 desc_logistics_expert_personality: "This ruler is a Logistics Expert. Talented in the art of managing resources and manpower in warfare, this individual ensures the security and efficiency of our army's supply lines, even when our ruler is commanding them far from the field in the comfort of the capital." 
 desc_humble_personality: "This ruler is Humble. While not necessarily an incapable ruler by any means, this ruler feels no shame in stepping back and allowing more experienced and skilled advisors to take care of state matters for them. This humility is seen even by foreign nations, who often receive gifts and praise from our ruler."
 desc_earthwork_expert_personality: "This ruler is an Earthwork Expert. Skilled in all things involving the shaping and development of land, this ruler ensures that construction is both fast and efficient."
 desc_cultured_personality: "This ruler is Cultured. Well-versed in all that is intellectual, this ruler's good manners and refined education has earned the respect and admiration of foreign diplomats and rulers alike."
 desc_crafty_merchant_personality: "This ruler is a Crafty Merchant. The head of the state in name but a gold-seeking merchant at heart, this ruler feels no shame in using their political and military position as the head of state to pursue commercial interests and fill their coffers."
 desc_impartial_personality: "This ruler is Impartial. Willing to lend an ear to even the fiercest of rivals, this ruler is respected by all sides of any argument. Such a ruler finds greater ease in adapting to changes and handling subjects with a just and fair hand while still allowing dissenters to speak their mind."
 desc_puppet_master_personality: "This ruler is a Puppet Master. Skilled in the manipulation and appeasement of subjects, this ruler can extract greater sums of manpower and gold from their vassals without protest from the latter."
 desc_galvanizing_orator_personality: "This ruler is a Galvanizing Orator. Their ability to instil even the laziest and apathetic of commonfolk with fighting spirit is unparalleled. Able to rouse all of our peoples to war with a mere speech, this ruler will not be satisfied if their talents are not put to use."
 desc_reliable_personality: "This ruler is Reliable. Unfailingly willing to answer their allies in times of need, other friendly nations are much more likely to aid this ruler when they are in need as well. As a result, our ruler is held in great esteem in the realm of global diplomacy and politics." 
 desc_defiant_personality: "This ruler is Defiant. Unwilling to surrender even in the face of certain defeat, this ruler can rally all troops and peoples within our nation to stand firm when under siege. With such a stubborn ruler at the helm, our people cannot help but stand alongside them to the very end."
 desc_provacateur_personality: "This ruler is a Provocateur. Talented in the art of stirring trouble and delighting in incensing even the most level-headed of foreign rulers and diplomats, their sharp tongue ensures that this mischief is not wasted, as it makes insults very effective in boosting our power projection."
 desc_populist_personality: "This ruler is a Populist. Placing the issues of the people before all other matters, this ruler is well-liked by the people, and talented officials of all classes flock to their court. This ruler is also more likely to focus on the homefront and the welfare of the people, and refrain from waging needless wars." 
 desc_avowed_pacifist_personality: "This ruler is an Avowed Pacifist. Very vocal in their preaching of peace, this ruler is unlikely to wage war even when there is a casus belli, and even less likely to declare war on weaker states. Because their pacifism is known to all neighboring states, however, when war is necessary this ruler is less likely to be seen as an aggressor."
 desc_good_caesar_personality: "This ruler is a Good Ruler. Talented and virtuous enough to be comparable to the Five Good Emperors of the Ancient Empires, our country is truly blessed to have such a great ruler."
 desc_prodigy_personality: "This ruler is a Prodigy. Showing extraordinary talent in multiple different fields and great promise from a young age, our state and country are sure to prosper under their rule."
 
 desc_impaler_personality: "This ruler is an Impaler. Taking twisted pleasure in the impalement of both enemies and allies alike, this ruler is one who razes as a pastime. The threat of impalement certainly keeps rebels in check, but it also alienates foreign powers, making diplomacy quite difficult... especially when our ruler can't resist impaling their ambassadors."
 desc_extravagant_personality: "This ruler is Extravagant. Wasteful in spending, an Extravagant ruler builds only the most sumptuous of castles and wears the most expensive garb in the land... even when in debt. However, the habit of showering lavish gifts on foreign rulers and throwing expensive parties for noblemen makes him very likable among the ruling class."
 desc_easygoing_personality: "This ruler is Easygoing. Lax in domestic and military affairs, our armies will lack discipline, and local officials will have greater autonomy. At the same time, a hands-off approach means that our people are more content and less likely to rebel."
 desc_puritan_personality: "This ruler is Puritan. Morally strict and simple in living, our ruler believes in the purification of the true faith and the Church. Disregarding the more primitive heathens, our ruler instead takes greater issue with Heretics, those deemed to be making the true faith impure."
 desc_seducer_personality: "This ruler is a Seductor. Skilled in appealing to others' emotional needs and desires, he is very effective in gathering information from foreign families in the private, although this negatively affects us in the eyes of the church. (Because this ruler is male, the chances of seducing and hiring women of talent is much higher)"
 desc_seductress_personality: "This ruler is a Seductress. Skilled in appealing to others' emotional needs and desires, she is very effective in gathering information from foreign families in the private, although this negatively affects us in the eyes of the church."
 desc_proud_personality: "This ruler is Proud. Holding themselves in great importance, perhaps much more so than they should, a Proud ruler earns him or herself the disdain of all foreign rulers and diplomats alike. However, such a high image of oneself does have some benefits, as someone so vain may win over the people with exaggerated achievements and gigantic monuments."
 desc_cynical_personality: "This ruler is Cynical. A skeptic of all things, ranging from shady diplomats to their true faith, our ruler is the opposite of a spiritual ruler. However, such a cynical view of the world is also quite helpful in catching acts of foreign espionage."
 desc_trusting_personality: "This ruler is Trusting. While this leaves our nation vulnerable to foreign espionage, our ruler's trusting nature also means more relaxed relations with foreign diplomats, making establishing friendly relations easier with arriving diplomats and, thus, their sovereigns."
 desc_hotheaded_personality: "This ruler is Hotheaded. Always taking up arms at every little perceived offense, this ruler is too stubborn to back down or surrender even in the face of defeat. This trait, while helpful in inspiring our soldiers during wartime, takes quite the hit on our reputation during times of peace."
 desc_reckless_leader_personality: "This ruler is a Reckless Leader. Ordering his men to charge headlong in battle, and sometimes even leading the vanguard themselves, this ruler often quickly depletes our resources through their continual reckless and aggressive campaigns into enemy lands."
 desc_unorthodox_personality: "This ruler is Unorthodox. Habitually going against the orthodox doctrine, this ruler often sympathizes with heretics, sometimes unintentionally. Although claiming to follow the true faith, their actions speak louder than their words... and their actions are saying that this ruler is a heretic."
 desc_ethnocentric_personality: "This ruler is Ethnocentric. While not outright xenophobic, this ruler will promote their own culture and peoples above all else, oftentimes at the expense of other cultural minorities. Such a ruler will attempt to shape others in the mold of their own culture and aim to conquer lands inhabited by cultures aligning with their own." 
 desc_pyromaniac_personality: "This ruler is a Pyromaniac. Taking strange delight in watching things burn, whether they be buildings, farms, or people, this ruler's fiery method of warfare makes conquered peoples much more difficult to pacify after burning down their homes. Fortunately, however, our ruler is sure to secure the gold before setting fire to our enemies' treasury."
 desc_ruthless_personality: "This ruler is Ruthless. Believing wholeheartedly that the ends justify the means, this ruler will do whatever it takes to achieve their goal. Unfortunately, this quality is well known to all foreign rulers, many of whom keep an eye on our ruler for any signs of aggression."
 desc_two_faced_personality: "This ruler is Two-Faced. Excelling at acting kind, albeit insincerely, to diplomats and foreign families, in truth this ruler is a tyrant at the home. Foreign powers may see this ruler as a kind and trustworthy individual, but their people know exactly what kind of ruler they are beneath the facade."
 desc_overly_generous_personality: "This ruler is Overly Generous. While their great magnanimity keeps all of their subjects happy and loyal to the state, their habits of taking these funds directly from the treasury often empty our coffers much faster than their statesmen would prefer."
 
 desc_paranoid_personality: "This ruler is Paranoid. Sleeping with one eye open, this may catch more cases of treachery, but such a ruler is also more likely of suspecting the innocent and employing less talented advisors. Thus, overestimating the enemy, being wary of diplomatic offers, and preemptive betrayal of otherwise innocent allies are all common among paranoid rulers."
 desc_immature_personality: "This ruler is Immature. Childish and impulsive, our ruler acts crudely at inappropriate times; as a result, none take us seriously. But this is a double-edged sword, however, as they are less likely to acknowledge our expansions a legitimate threat, perhaps out of embarrassment of feeling threatened by a man-child of a ruler." 
 desc_lustful_personality: "This ruler is Lustful. Preoccupied only by sexual desire, this ruler is eager to engage in numerous royal marriages without care for political consequences. Having a poor reputation among the Church, as a result, a Lustful ruler is also more likely to be deceived through seduction by foreign spies."
 desc_unfaithful_personality: "This ruler is Unfaithful. Often breaking promises, including marriage vows, our ruler has built up a poor reputation from betrayal in both the realms of diplomacy and the bedroom. An unfaithful ruler is surrounded by a heavy aura of bad karma, and thus other nations are more likely to view us with caution."
 desc_overbearing_personality: "This ruler is Overbearing. Habitually speaking with a condescending tone, whether purposefully or not, our ruler is likely to offend our subjects by asserting too much authority over them. Our ruler is also less likely to accept offers of alliances from those deemed as lesser powers."
 desc_indecisive_personality: "This ruler is Indecisive. Struggling to reach a decision, our ruler may issue confusing or contradicting orders, slowing down the speed at which our armies mobilize. An indecisive ruler is also more likely to miss golden opportunities and abstain from taking action, or may declare wars coupled with poor timing."
 desc_sadistic_personality: "This ruler is Sadistic. Taking pleasure in watching others suffer, they are much more likely to raze and loot provinces. They also enjoy abusing their subjects and publicly executing traitors of the court in gruesome ways, which lowers subject opinion. At the same time, it may make those of our homeland think twice before rebelling."
 desc_barbaric_personality: "This ruler is Barbaric. The opposite of a civilized man of the court, our ruler's crude actions has earned him the mockery of foreign courts throughout the land. At the same time, our ruler's rowdiness has attracted the company of rough mercenaries, often drinking together late into the night and returning to the court hungover."
 desc_inferiority_complex_personality: "This ruler has an Inferiority Complex. Always perceiving others as greater in military and culture, our ruler will go to unnecessary ends to build the grandest, costliest ships and architecture to prove their worth. Such a ruler will also drag out wars to claim shallow 'merits' in battle."
 desc_xenophobic_personality: "This ruler is Xenophobic. Extremely intolerant towards other cultures, it will be exponentially more difficult to accept any culture other than our own. This ruler is also more likely to employ only those of the same culture and nationality within their inner circle."
 desc_dull_personality: "This ruler is Stupid. Taking little interest in... anything, our ruler is less likely to pick up on new ideas or pay attention to the politics of our court, let alone global politics. Unfortunately for their consort, this insipidness also applies to the private chambers..."
 desc_treacherous_personality: "This ruler is Treacherous. Having no qualms in betraying anyone, even those of the same kin, this ruler will break alliances without hesitation. Although this activity gives us a terrible reputation, it makes it much easier for us to fabricate claims, especially with typical, standard morality being out of the question."
 desc_timid_personality: "This ruler is Timid. Although not necessarily a poor ruler or leader, this ruler will be intimidated by disgruntled citizens, and if tensions rise to the point that rebellion breaks out, this ruler will be unable to handle the pressure and find greater difficulty in suppressing the revolt. This ruler is also more likely to accept offers of peace from their enemies during war."
 desc_kinslayer_personality: "This ruler is a Kinslayer. Paranoid about the legitimacy of their heir and dominion, a Kinslayer will undergo all means to ensure a safe succession for their heir, whether through killing rival family members or by accepting royal marriages to ensure a legitimate heir. For someone who has no qualms with killing kin, killing their rebelling subjects should not be a problem either."
 desc_content_personality: "This ruler is Content. Completely satisfied with the comforts of the capital, this ruler has little to no ambition of expanding the nation beyond its current borders. Such a ruler is much less likely to declare war and, when war is necessary, is often unenthusiastic in making the proper preparations of war, such as producing official documents and conducting espionage."
 desc_delusional_personality: "This ruler is Delusional. Believing themselves to be completely immune to danger, our ruler underestimates the odds of war and is thus more likely to openly declare war with powerful nations. Pushing our armies to unrealistic standards and exhausting our nation's resources, other nations are also less likely to aid us in our ruler's reckless military pursuits."
 desc_envious_personality: "This ruler is Envious. Always coveting the material wealth and prestige of other nations and their ruling class, a nation under this ruler is much harder to establish mutual diplomatic relations with; once an alliance is established, however, this ruler is reluctant to help their allies in any way, and may even betray their allies outright if he feels humiliated by their superior wealth."
 desc_slothful_personality: "This ruler is Slothful. This ruler would rather turn over in his bed and go back to sleep, delaying the dispatch of envoys on important diplomatic matters as well as the construction of key projects. This ruler also prefers to gain land through coercion rather than launch a preemptive strike themselves."
 desc_ignorant_personality: "This ruler is Ignorant. Completely disregarding warnings, customs and knowledge in general, oftentimes willfully, this ruler has a particular talent in offending most people they interact with, and a particular lack of talent when it comes to grasping new ideas and innovations."
 desc_unprincipled_ruffian_personality: "This ruler is an Unprincipled Ruffian. Employing street thugs who answer only to their command, their methods are effective in suppressing feelings of revolt, though only temporarily, as their street gangs are undisciplined and violent enough to start riots on their own."
 desc_senile_personality: "This ruler is Senile. Unfortunately, this ruler's old age has taken a toll on their ability. This makes diplomacy increasingly difficult, as other nations are much less willing to aid a ruler who cannot even handle the affairs of their state without their officials shouldering all of the work."

 philosopher_desc: "Philosophy is a common discipline in Tamriel, especially in Cyrodiil. Akaviri and Tamrielic philosophies are radically different, but they share a common goal of understanding the universe with the interference of neither Aedra nor Daedra and coming to rational conclusions about the nature of Mundus and all of the Aurbis."
 theorist_desc: "Theorists study the various ways that the beings and environments of the Aurbis, and formulate theories to predict future interaction. They are common in many courts throughout Nirn and Oblivion, and their work is regarded on par with philosophy and the higher sciences."
 savant_desc: "Savants are some of the greatest and wisest people in all of the Arubis. They often specialize in one specific subject of study, which makes them often short-sighted, but their works are unparalleled in their fields."
 natural_scientist_desc: "Natural Scientists study all things non-magical, in any realm. They use empirical, observational or experimental evidence to come to conclusions about  their world, whether of Mundus, Aetherius, or Oblivion, and they are well regarded in many courts of the Aurbis."
 scholar_desc: "Scholars are general researchers and knowledge keepers of their realms, and while they may not be as well known as specialists such as natural scientists, savants, or philosophers, their broad view of knowledge allows them to more easily provide key information and knowledge to leaders of nations in Nirn or Oblivion."
 researcher_desc: "Researchers are well known in the worlds of the Aurbis. They specialize in gathering, collating, and transforming information and knowledge - often for the benefits of their patrons in the courts or leadership of their home nation."
 artist_desc: "Artists take many forms, just as art is as diverse as life itself, and are found throughout the many worlds of Nirn and Oblivion. Their works adorn the halls of the Aurbis’s greatest courts, and inspire patriotism for their home countries."

 es_terrain.1.t: "The Sand Storm"
 es_terrain.1.d: "The terrible sandstorm that broke out in one of our deserts is gaining strength more and more every day. A hurricane wind sweeps the nomad settlements, and in large cities, it fells trees and breaks windows. From everywhere there are reports of injured citizens - wounded and killed. If the situation does not change, then soon the whole region will be buried under a meter layer of sand. It seems we will have to prepare for difficult times."
 es_terrain.1.a: "This is Horrible!"
 
 es_terrain.7.t: "Tropical Storms"
 es_terrain.7.d: "Recently, the number of storms has increased. It is difficult to say what caused this - increased wind, too warm weather in the summer, or the will of the gods. However, more and more ships do not return from distant lands, and local hoaxes suffer losses due to incessant heavy rains."
 es_terrain.7.a: "These are temporary difficulties."
 
 es_terrain.11.t: "The Flood"
 es_terrain.11.d: "Floods have always happened in our lands. From year to year, they damaged the lands of our farmers, took the lives of our citizens and perpetuated in history thanks to paintings, legends and memorials. But recently, their strength has increased, and now many of our cities are gradually going underwater. Old people say that soon the water will subside, as it did many times. But what if the floods don't stop?"
 es_terrain.11.a: "It's time to fill the bags with sand."

 es_terrain.16.t: "The Ice Age"
 es_terrain.16.d: "Every year, winter comes to our region, turning water and blood to ice. We are used to it and we learn to adapt. However, with each its arrival, winter is becoming stronger and takes away more and more of our strengths and lives. Probably someday we will leave the lifeless lands that were once our home and now turn into ice wastelands. But for now, we will stay here."

 es_orcish_flavour.1.t: "Fury of Orcs"
 es_orcish_flavour.1.d: "From all over the mountains and hills you can hear the wild howling of the hordes of orcs, whose fury does not know the limit. Soon, their wild flocks will gather together to sow chaos and horror in the expanse of Nirn. Get ready... Not everyone will be able to live to see the sunset of the next day."
 es_orcish_flavour.1.a: "War-ar!"
 es_orcish_flavour.2.t: "Who Will Lead New Campaign?"
 es_orcish_flavour.2.d: "Our brave wars are going to another campaign on the enemy's land for fame and prey. But the successful completion of such an event is unlikely without competent and skilful leadership. Many believe that it is our leader who should take the lead in the united army. But it is necessary to remember that it will put his life, as well as the fate of the ruling clan in jeopardy."
 es_orcish_flavour.2.a: "Luck and glory will be on the Chief's side!"
 es_orcish_flavour.2.b: "We will find someone else."
 es_orcish_flavour.3.t: "The Chief is Captured"
 es_orcish_flavour.3.d: "According to unconfirmed information, our ruler was captured by the enemy when personally leading the soldiers into battle. Despite his strength and the elite soldiers who accompanied him, he was trapped and forced to fight with superior forces without the possibility of retreat. Surprisingly, the ruler let himself be taken prisoner, but that is exactly what the envoy claims. We have time before sundown to pay the ransom. But who would need such a weak leader?"
 es_orcish_flavour.3.a: "We will pay the ransom."
 es_orcish_flavour.3.b: "Kill the envoy and elect new Chief!"
 es_orcish_flavour.4.t: "Successful Campaign"
