 cataclysm.1.title: "Discontent in the Horde"

As Warchief, you do your best to keep the Horde together. Yet, you are also obligated to uphold the Horde's honour at all costs.\n\nDuring one of the meetings regarding The Horde's future, [fellow_horde.GetName] dared to disrespect you and your honour. To protect our honour and prestige, we must react accordingly."

 cataclysm.2.title: "Duel of Honour"
 cataclysm.2.desc: "As a result of rising dissent within The Horde, [fellow_horde.Monarch.GetName] has challenged you an honour duel. In Horde tradition, refusing a duel is the most shameful act a ruler can commit. But there is also the possibility of death."

 cataclysm.3.title: "Life purpose fullfilled!"

 cataclysm.3.opt2: "I can't. I still have people to lead."
 cataclysm.3.opt1.tooltip: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] dies or..?!"
 
 cataclysm.4.title: "In The Void!"
 cataclysm.4.desc: "It's over.\n\nYou are dead. Death, despite what you expected, didn't bring peace, but more agony and pain.\n\nYet in the endless ocean of void and horror, you heard a voice. Nine Val'kyr, unbound from The Lich King's grasp, approached you and offered a pact. They offer freedom, life… and power over death..."
 cataclysm.4.opt1: "Accept the gift"
 cataclysm.4.opt2: "I don't make deals with scourge fiends."
 cataclysm.4.opt2.tooltip: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] dies!"
 
 cataclysm.5.title: "Power to Reanimate"
 cataclysm.5.desc: "Our manpower supplies are dangerously low. But since now we have The Val'kyr on our side, we can reanimate the dead to resupply our manpower. This might look like an evil act to those who don't understand the nature of undeath, yet we can't turn down this chance to use our new allies.\n\n... Where to find these dead bodies, is entirely up to us."
 cataclysm.5.opt1: "Find and reanimate the soldiers that we lost in battle"
 cataclysm.5.opt2: "Raid the tombs in occupied provinces"
 cataclysm.5.opt3: "We cannot afford make our allies angry right now"
 
 cataclysm.6.title: "Migration of Gilneans"
 cataclysm.6.desc: "The Kingdom of Gilneas no longer exists! The Gilnean lands are being ravaged by her enemies and rampaging feral worgens.\n\n Since they are a member of the Grand Alliance of Lordearon, it is only natural to help her citizens in need. But immigrants often bring their problem with them and It might be not wise to open our gates to them completely."
 cataclysm.6.opt1: "Welcome all Gilneans to [Root.GetName] and your court"
 cataclysm.6.opt2: "Let Gilnean immigrants in"
 cataclysm.6.opt3: "No furries!"
