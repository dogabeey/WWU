 aldorscryer_events.1.title: "The Aldor and Scryers"
 aldorscryer_events.1.desc: "When the blood elves arrived at Shattrath, a number of them sensed the powerful Naaru inside the city and laid down their weapons, giving up the cause of Kael'Thas Sunstrider and instead declaring themselves loyal to this powerful being. These were called the Scryers. Inside the city, remnants of Draenei still existed that were also loyal to this Naaru, called the Aldor. These two factions are at odds with each other, both competing for the attention and rewards of the Naaru."
