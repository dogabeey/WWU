'Your rule has brought this nation to the brink of destruction, and shame to our family.' $HEIR_CAP_S_PRONOUN$ looks nervously at $HEIR_ADJ$ co-conspirators.

 wwu_dynastic.7.desc: "Suddenly something startles the animal and, before you have time to fire, it is long gone. You look around you. The water in the small creek reflects the sunlight of a perfect day, and the reeds wave slowly before a light breeze. Is that laughter? You realize now what had startled the animal.

 wwu_dynastic.10.title: "Family Secret?"
 wwu_dynastic.10.desc: "The first time you brush it off, but when it happens a second and a third time, you do begin to wonder. Why are people laughing at you when they think you can't hear them? After you've asked around, for more than a bit, you finally manage to get an answer out of a chamber maid. It appears that your heir has been running about town in a most uncouth fashion, and that your family is now becoming the laughing stock of Azeroth."

 wwu_dynastic.12.title: "Regent usurps The Throne"

With God on my side, I shall, therefore, assume the throne for myself. Good Night, Sweet Prince.'"

 wwu_dynastic.13.title: "Lux Stella"
 wwu_dynastic.13.desc: "The thread of fate is fickle, and balances on the razor's edge between the sublime and the eternal. Fickle, are the vagaries of destiny. Jupiter ascendant, and the moon is in the seventh house. Who he is, I do not know, but the stars foretell that a man born to a royal house on this day, shall one day be the ruler of a mighty kingdom.' Thus the astrologer spoke.

 wwu_dynastic.16.title: "Fear and Loathing in $PROVINCENAME$"
 wwu_dynastic.16.desc: "Twilight is always the worst. The clouds racing circles across moonless skies, cruel stars suspended like grains of broken glass, and chandeliers throwing strange shadows across the Royal Chambers. Lately, a strange sense has come upon you that there is something wrong with the place. The geometry of it seems... unsound. Thinking back... it all started with the birth of $HEIR$."
 wwu_dynastic.16.option.a: "All work and no play, makes $MONARCH$ a dull, dull boy."

 wwu_dynastic.16.option.c: "..."
 
 wwu_dynastic.17.title: "The Discovery"
 wwu_dynastic.17.desc: "My $MONARCHTITLE$...' you sense instantly that there is something wrong. There is something in his voice, right below the surface. Hidden contempt, and fear. '...the new brick wall in the eastern cellar. It wasn't built for insulation, was it?' You remember it clearly now. How small the body felt. Carrying it down into the damp cellar, laying the bricks. It made you sick. Sick to the core. Killing your progeny wasn't the catharsis you had expected it to be. For an instant, the flashing glimpse of an insight blows across your mind..."
 wwu_dynastic.17.option.a: "What have I done!?"
 wwu_dynastic.17.option.b: "Heeere's $MONARCH$!"
 
 wwu_dynastic.18.title: "Dance Macabre"
 wwu_dynastic.18.desc: "The Royal Chamber is a swirling mist of scents and shapes, coming and going into and out of existence like colorful snowflakes. You are hungry. So very hungry. As if you hadn't eaten in months. The stars looking down on you, still suspended in a moonless sky, laugh and dance. They seem free, and wild. There is something about those stars. They seem so... right. You have gone quite insane."
 wwu_dynastic.18.option.a: "Not by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin!"
 wwu_dynastic.18.option.b: "I'd give my god-damned soul for just a glass of beer."

 wwu_dynastic.19.title: "Our Monarch Dies"
 wwu_dynastic.19.desc: "Our monarch has died, and considering the strange things he was saying toward the end of his life, perhaps it is for the better."
 wwu_dynastic.19.option.a: "God bless his soul"
 
 wwu_dynastic.20.title: "Wedding Bells"
 wwu_dynastic.20.desc: "Sire...', again the advisor interrupts you, their furrowed brow telling tall tales of concern and sleepless nights. '... the succession does not secure itself, your majesty...' On they go. This dusty old study, and your advisor's dry voice resonating of boredom and wasted potential, accentuates the brightness of the clear day outside. '...which is why it is of vital importance that...' - Don't they ever stop? 'In nature', you find yourself saying in interruption, 'the first step, leading an animal into the grave, is always procreation.' You're not sure if you believe it, only that there is nothing in their voice to convince you that marriage is preferable to the promise of a clear sky."

 wwu_dynastic.20.option.b: "Chess on the veranda?"
 
 wwu_dynastic.21.title: "A Modest Proposal"
 wwu_dynastic.21.desc: "While it is not uncommon among a certain type of young men to wish to remain outside the inevitable bonds of wedlock, the bonds are inevitable nevertheless. Looking out from your eagle's perch, you have spotted prey. The ruler of this foreign country has for a long time been postponing his marriage, and his throne lacks a secure succession. This might be the perfect time to form a dynastic bond between our countries. Should we dispatch an embassy to try to marry one of our dynasty's young girls into this foreign royal house?"

 wwu_dynastic.22.title: "A rose from a foreign land"
 wwu_dynastic.22.desc: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent you a painting, depicting a young girl in his court. Her eyes are green, her hair is black, and your eyes are drawn to the painting as if to a vacuum. A cunning smile find its way to your advisor's face. The noise of the room dies down. You do not know how long you stand there looking. She is beautiful."
 wwu_dynastic.22.option.a: "I must have her!"
 wwu_dynastic.22.option.b: "What is this foul witchcraft? Begone!"
 
 wwu_dynastic.23.title: "A thorn from a foreign land"
 wwu_dynastic.23.desc: "While the poor quality of the painting might explain away some of it, the fact remains that The Creator was not being overly generous when he endowed this girl with her looks. The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered her hand in marriage, and you are not sure if you should laugh or feel insulted. Then again, there is the succession to consider."
 wwu_dynastic.23.option.a: "A good $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ woman, I'm sure."
 wwu_dynastic.23.option.b: "This will obviously not do."
 
 wwu_dynastic.24.title: "The Aftermath"
 wwu_dynastic.24.desc: "'Our last war was an abject failure, and you know it!', the anger in your heir's voice is unmistakable. True, mistakes were made during the war, but all of them were hardly yours. Besides, $HEIRNAME$ also commanded troops. 'I believe it is time for you to retire.' 'The audacity...'"
 wwu_dynastic.24.option.a: "I accept responsibility"
 wwu_dynastic.24.option.b: "I will not be met with insolence in my own house!"
 
 wwu_dynastic.25.title: "$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Moon"
 wwu_dynastic.25.desc: "The garden is bathed in the cool light of a full moon. Turning a corner to come across this sight was not what you had expected, but here it is. Before you stands a monument to $RANDOM_OLD_WAR$. The beauty lies not in the exquisite marble, or even in the craftsmanship of the thing, but in the fact that even now, many years later, the monument is still strewn with thousands and thousands of fresh flowers. Here, if nowhere else, the memory of $RANDOM_OLD_WAR$, and the memories of the fallen, still lives."
 wwu_dynastic.25.option.a: "May the memory live on"
 wwu_dynastic.25.option.b: "Our sorrow proves the justness of our cause."
 
 wwu_dynastic.26.title: "Seeing The Real You"
 wwu_dynastic.26.desc: "She turns around. She looks at you. - 'Have you prayed lately, $MONARCH$?' The question underscores the distance between you that, for the past year, has been growing. - 'I think you should. I do. Almost every night.' You laugh. For all her human flaws she is still your wife. She draws closer, the hint of a smile spreading across her face. - 'What are you laughing at, $MONARCH$'?"
 wwu_dynastic.26.option.a: "I just realized how much you mean to me."
 wwu_dynastic.26.option.b: "The economy is doing laughably good! Haha!"
 
 wwu_dynastic.27.title: "Starlight"
 wwu_dynastic.27.desc: "The birth of an heir draws nearer, and the astrologer has just completed his work. He proclaims that a child born to a royal house on this day shall rule a mighty kingdom and is about to continue when the feeble sound of a newborn's first scream is heard. 'A daughter,' the midwife announces, 'You have a healthy, sturdy daughter, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].'"

 wwu_dynastic.28.option.a: "I declare her my new heir."
 wwu_dynastic.28.option.b: "I want a male heir!"
 
 wwu_dynastic.29.title: "Talented and Ambitious Daughter"
 wwu_dynastic.29.desc: "The lack of an heir is worrying both the people of [Root.Country.GetName] and your advisors. You have an ambitious and talented daughter who has impressed both diplomats, foreign nobles and your personal advisors with her wit and cunning. Is it not time to consider her as the heir to the throne?"
 wwu_dynastic.29.option.a: "She would make an excellent ruler."
 wwu_dynastic.29.option.b: "I am not dead yet! I can still sire a son or two."
 
 wwu_dynastic.30.title: "The Ruler's Daughter"
 wwu_dynastic.30.desc: "The old ruler left this earth without a male heir, but their daughter is a talented and intelligent woman. She has a claim to the throne few others can compete with, and the wit needed to keep it. There is a man from another county who has also made a claim on the throne, and although it is not as strong, there are those who would prefer to see a man on the throne rather than a woman."
 wwu_dynastic.30.option.a: "Crown the former ruler's daughter."
 wwu_dynastic.30.option.b: "Choose the foreign noble."
