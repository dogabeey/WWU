 wwu_pirate_ruler_death.1.title: "Rum Deal"
 wwu_pirate_ruler_death.1.desc: "With another victory on their belt, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to host a loud party and to pay out a massive amount of rum to celebrate their victory. The party became quite rowdy with free rum flowing freely amongst the pirates of [Root.Capital.GetName] The party goers went door to door, looting and pillaging and singing for four days straight. When the daze of partying and shooting finally died down, an important question was on everyone’s mind? Where was [Root.Monarch.GetName]? As it would turn out, the ruling captain had gotten into a bar fight with his own supporters, and got into a shooting frenzy with a mixture of pirates. The ruler then fought and bled his way through the streets, was grabbed by drunken party goers, and thrown from the docks where they drowned. Our republic mourns the tragic passing of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and likely the scholars will write a more dignified death for them later."

Two rival captains were duking it out between two popular bars, and our ruling captain happened to come on by. A three way sword fight occurred, killing important government officials in an increasingly violent and deadly confrontation and curse laden dialogue till [Root.Monarch.GetName] came out as victorious. However, exhausted and tired after the brutal fighting, [Root.Monarch.GetHeHer] began fidgeting with their pistol, setting it  off in their face, killing [Root.Monarch.GetName] instantly. The tragic death, along with the deaths of various rival leaders and government officials has left our pirate republic in a bit of a mess."

 wwu_pirate_ruler_death.3.desc: "Disagreements between pirate captains are not uncommon, but with our lax rules, assassinations are more and more commonplace. One group, angry about the way the republic is going, decided in a drunken frenzy to enact a sudden coup. This small horde of pirates assaulted their way into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s office and began shooting and murdering their way to the office of the ruling captain. The first wave of pirates ended up shot by [Root.Monarch.GetName], several mages ended up slain in the next. Confidence overcame [Root.Monarch.GetName] who came out to directly challenge his would be usurpers, just as said usurpers rolled in a loaded cannon and blasted them to smithereens. Although the coup certainly didn’t overwhelm the republic and the rabble was dispersed, our society is once again shaken by the easily angered buccaneers."
