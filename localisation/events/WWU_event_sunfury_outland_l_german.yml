 sunfury_outland.1.desc: "The high elf remnants have reorganized under Kael'Thas Sunstrider and are now calling themselves the blood elves. With the assistance of Illidan's Naga they have escaped through a portal to the shattered world of Draenor, now known as Outland. Here they will make a new home and seek a new font of power to sustain them. The local Ashtongue Deathsworn Broken, leftovers of the Draenei, are eager to make allies of these newcomers to aid them against the Fel Horde."
