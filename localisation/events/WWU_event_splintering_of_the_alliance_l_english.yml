 alliance_splinter.1.desc: "Following the defeat of [example_unaccepted_province.Culture.GetGroupName] armies in war, seeds of disarray were started to grow within The Alliance of [Root.GetName]. Disagreements over what to do with their population, mostly pertaining to internment camp costs, created tension between some member states of the Alliance. Without a common foe to fight against, the members could not find a motivation to stay in The Alliance. A polemic between [alliance_splinter_subject_1.GetName]'s leader, [alliance_splinter_subject_1.Monarch.GetName] and $MONARCH$ regarding what to with [example_unaccepted_province.Culture.GetGroupName] population eventually caused the members to take sides: Purging the entire population, or assimilating them via internment camps. \n\nThis serious division raised some uncertainity about The Alliance's future. Regardless of the outcome, this tension is probably going to lead Splintering of The Alliance."
