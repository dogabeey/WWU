 wwu_gurubashi_conflict.1.desc: "Years after the Gnoll War, from which the humans emerged victorious, the isolated Kingdom of Stormwind continued to prosper in the southeastern areas of the Eastern Kingdoms.

In particular, vast new territories were claimed south of the human nation, located perilously close to the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale — our ancient homeland.\n\nWe must do something about these new human settlers and draw a line before they get any bolder."
