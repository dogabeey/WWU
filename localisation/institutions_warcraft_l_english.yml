 warcraft_institutions.10.title: "Demonology"
 warcraft_institutions.10.desc: "Demonology is the study and practice of demons. Kil'jeaden the Deceiver was the first being who brought demonology and demonic teaching to Draenor and since then, numbers of Warlocks are increasing rapidly. By their very nature, demons are leeches on the living universe—but the demonologist has mastered harnessing the power of these malefic beings on the field of battle. Warlocks harvest the souls of their defeated enemies; those specialized in the ways of demonology use this life essence to tap into the Void or to pull all manner of abomination from the chaos of the Twisting Nether. We will use this to fuel our armies with the power of fel and triumph over our enemies."
