 wwu_druidic_syncretism_reform: "Druidic Syncretism"
 wwu_druidic_syncretism_reform_desc: "The most popular disciples of druidic rituals in Kalimdor have always been the Night Elves.

 wwu_elvish_nobles_reform: "Empower the Elvish Nobility"
 wwu_elvish_nobles_reform_desc: "Our lands are full of smaller local tribes and clans that we could put to good use if we gave them a place within the system of our state. As a class these High Elf officials could serve as police, builders of fortifications, local representatives and military officers. Most of all they could mobilize their kinsmen and provide us with a good source of able men."
 
 wwu_strength_of_the_vrykul_reform: "Strength of the Vrykul"
 wwu_strength_of_the_vrykul_reform_desc: "With the Vrykul people united behind us there is little we could not do.\nWe cannot however become the oppressors we have once fought, all will be able to rise to power within our state."

 wwu_of_noble_bearing_reform_desc: "The noble families of the realm have sworn to provide not only council but also eternal loyalty to our monarch.

 wwu_meritocratic_focus_reform: "Meritocratic Recruitment"
 wwu_meritocratic_focus_reform_desc: "We cannot let old privileges govern who will get the privilege of serving our kingdom as it grows.

 wwu_dwarven_culture_reform: "Dwarven Culture"
 wwu_dwarven_culture_reform_desc: "As our kingdom grows and matures a joint Titanic culture has started to emerge among the elite of the various great cities of the Dwaves.

 wwu_formalized_hoof_reform: "Formalized Hoof System"

 wwu_consolidation_of_power_reform: "Consolidation of Power"
 wwu_consolidation_of_power_reform_desc: "The current terms for officials are too short to see through larger projects. This only feeds populism and leads to short-sighted policies.
