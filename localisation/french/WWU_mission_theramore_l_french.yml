Let us quickly dispatch our civilian force to these provinces and begin setup of a proper capital."

Here we shall declare our own Kingdom under our new Queen Jaina Proudmoore. Our brief time in Kalimdor is already forging a new cultural identity amongst our diverse people, who are beginning to call themselves 'Theramoreans'."
