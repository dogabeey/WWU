 wwu_states_general.1.t: "[Root.GetAdjectiveCap] Assembly Abolished"
 wwu_states_general.1.d1: "After years of bickering, internal conflict, and delayed legislation, all have agreed that something must be done about the state of the Assembly.\n\nThe ancient House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], who for years have been biding their time, has, in a superbly timed maneouvre, spearheaded a bill abolishing the assembly altogether, and reinstating [Root.Monarch.GetName] on the throne of [Root.GetName]."
 wwu_states_general.1.d2: "Years of internal strife within the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] Assembly have begun to take their toll on the national spirit of [Root.GetName]. The rising popular opinion against the Assembly has drawn out many vocal opponents among our citizens.\n\nAt long last, one contender stands tall amidst his opponents, overthrowing what little opposition remains in the Assembly, and reinstating the glorious traditions of [Root.GetName]."
 wwu_states_general.1.a: "Long live [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 wwu_states_general.1.b: "Long live the [Root.GovernmentName]!"
