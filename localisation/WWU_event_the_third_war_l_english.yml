 scourge_events.1.title: "Nerzhul's Arrival to Icecrown Citadel"
 scourge_events.1.desc: "After the Shadow Council was weakened, fallen shaman Ner'zhul has risen to power once again with the help of Teron'gor. He quickly regained his power and found new followers for his crazy plan of conquest: Open even more portals to the other worlds and claim those For The Horde. Defying both Legion and his ancestors, Nerzhul opened a portal many worlds across the cosmos and eventually tore whole Dreanor apart!\n\nUpon escaping via one of these portals, Ner'zhul quickly was captured by Kil'jaeden and his followers were killed. Now a prisoner of The Burning Legion, Ner'zhul's entire body and soul was torn apart by Kil'jaeden himself. Under unspeakable torture, Ner'zhul accepted to serve under Legion once again but secrely he plotted for vengeance. His spirit was placed within a specially crafted block of diamond-hard ice gathered from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether. Encased within the frozen cask, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand fold. Warped by the demon's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul became a spectral being of unfathomable power. At that moment, the orc known as Ner'zhul was shattered forever, and the Lich King was born.\n\nWhen Kil'jaeden cast Ner'zhul's icy cask back into the world of Azeroth, the hardened crystal streaked across the night sky and smashed into the desolate arctic continent of Northrend, burying itself deep within the Icecrown glacier. The frozen crystal, warped and scarred by its violent descent, came to resemble a throne, and Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit soon stirred within it. From the confines of the Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul began to reach out his vast consciousness and touch the minds of Northrend's native inhabitants."
