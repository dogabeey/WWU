## End date should be 631 for all these - with Bolvar's ascension to the Frozen Throne, the Scourge no longer commands the other branches
## In year 631 - Darkmaster Gandling is the most powerfull necromancer of the Scourge in Lordaeron so he commands (idk if Blizzard will kill him in lore so...)
## No information found about Gandlings influences in Deatholme (maybe add 'Cult of the Damned - Deatholme'?)
